# NoteTaker
## Description

This is an application designed to allow busy people to take and keep track of notes to help organize thoughts and plans.  The user will be able to write, save, and delete notes.  They will be able to come back and view previously created notes.

I learned:  

1)  How to use express to set up a server and perform get, post, and delete methods.
2)  How to use fs for more than just creating text files. 
3)  How to deploy to Heroku.

Challenges:

While I managed to get the requests and responses to work to the point of console logging notes in the terminal, I found it difficult to get them to post to the other side of the html page using the pre-loaded code.
