# Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker

## Description

This is an application designed to allow busy people to take and keep track of notes to help organize thoughts and plans.  The user will be able to write, save, and delete notes.  They will be able to come back and view previously created notes.

* The following HTML routes should be created:

  * GET `/notes` - Should return the `notes.html` file.

  * GET `*` - Should return the `index.html` file

* The application should have a `db.json` file on the backend that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the `fs` module.

* The following API routes should be created:

  * GET `/api/notes` - Should read the `db.json` file and return all saved notes as JSON.

  * POST `/api/notes` - Should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client.

  * DELETE `/api/notes/:id` - Should receive a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete. This means you'll need to find a way to give each note a unique `id` when it's saved. In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the `db.json` file, remove the note with the given `id` property, and then rewrite the notes to the `db.json` file.
